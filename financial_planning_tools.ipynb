You’ll make an API call to Alpaca via the Alpaca SDK to get the current closing prices of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ticker: SPY) and of the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (ticker: AGG). For the prototype, assume that the member holds 110 shares of SPY, which represents the stock portion of their portfolio, and 200 shares of AGG, which represents the bond portion. To do all this, complete the following steps:\n",

    "    - `columns`: Set this parameter equal to a Python list with a single value called `amount`.\n",

    "    - `index`: Set this parameter equal to a Python list with the values of `crypto` and `stock/bond`.\n",

    "3. Use the `savings_df` DataFrame to plot a pie chart that visualizes the composition of the member’s portfolio. The y-axis of the pie chart uses `amount`. Be sure to add a title.\n",
